To execute the app:

1- Clone the repository
2- Import it into your favorite IDE
3- In case you have conflicts (very likely, thank you JMapViewer) you can download the JMapViewer .JAR here: "https://virtual.grado.ungs.edu.ar/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=50608"
4- When you have it downloaded, you should delete the previous .JAR from the build path of the project
5- Once deleted, you can just drag the new .JAR into the src folder, right click the file and select "add to build path"
6- Enjoy :)
