## To execute the app:

+ Clone the repository 

+ Import it into your favorite IDE

+ In case you have conflicts (very likely, thank you JMapViewer) you can download the JMapViewer .JAR here: "[JMapViewer .JAR](https://virtual.grado.ungs.edu.ar/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=50608)"

+ When you have it downloaded, you should delete the previous .JAR from the build path of the project

+ Once deleted, you can just drag the new .JAR into the src folder, right click the file and select "add to build path"

+ Enjoy :)
